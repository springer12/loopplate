The Chiefs are going to the postseason and even better they’re not going to have to leave home. A division title means you get to host a home playoff game and the Chiefs will do so on Wild Card weekend.</p>\r\n<p id=\"P2pY1w\">There’s a lot to like about this. The Chiefs will also get what is essentially a week off next week in Denver. The Chiefs can spend this time preparing for the playoffs and we know Andy Reid is usually pretty good with extra time to prepare. </p>\r\n<p id=\"mZISak\">MOST IMPORTANTLY ... Andy Reid came into the locker room dressed as Santa Claus!</p>\r\n<div id=\"Xke39l\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A Merry Chiefsmas to all! ~ Andy Reid/Santa   <a href=\"https://t.co/bO5RLUMSLL\">pic.twitter.com/bO5RLUMSLL</a></p>— Kansas City Chiefs (@Chiefs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chiefs/status/945043982152855552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 24, 2017</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n</div>\r\n<p id=\"BdCtme\">And he talked to the press like that!</p>\r\n<div id=\"5dEW6C\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Andy Reid dressed up as Santa in the post-game presser. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chiefs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Chiefs</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XfEETXhQmd\">pic.twitter.com/XfEETXhQmd</a></p>— Farzin Vousoughian (@Farzin21) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Farzin21/status/945045027297873920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 24, 2017</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n</div>\r\n<p id=\"xw5vPH\">HAPPY HOLIDAYS!</p>",

Smith launched it at about his own 25-yard line and it hit Hill at about the opposing 20. That’s 55 yards in the air and a perfect pass, and it needed to be as three Dolphins surrounded Hill. It was officially ruled a 52-yard gain.</p>\r\n<p id=\"08DwtC\">This was a positive moment because it reinforces a couple things:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li id=\"wUWjvc\">Smith appears to be more comfortable letting the football fly on looks he may not have previously been...</li>\r\n<li id=\"rDv3aQ\">...and that’s because Hill’s route running is improving every week and with that, so is Smith’s trust in him even if he may be covered.</li>\r\n<li id=\"vt6t1R\">If the Chiefs offense continues to show no fear throwing long balls like this, the defense will need to be cognizant, meaning only more room for other guys like Travis Kelce and Kareem Hunt.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 id=\"ceiFQX\"><strong>GOOD: Kelce’s touchdown catch. </strong></h3>\r\n<p id=\"IDdzgC\">Speaking of throwing to players who are covered, Travis Kelce was blanketed by Pro Bowl safety Reshad Jones and it didn’t matter. </p>\r\n<div id=\"X3tZBk\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-video\">\r\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Target Travis Kelce, profit.

The <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a> have a catch controversy on their hands after a play in Sunday’s game against the <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a>. Chiefs QB <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/1839/alex-smith\">Alex Smith</a> hit WR <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/276959/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a> for what looked like an amazing touchdown catch in the corner of the end zone.</p>\r\n<p id=\"r4ithS\">The refs, however, ruled it was NOT a catch. Chiefs coach Andy Reid threw his challenge flag and the refs went to look at it. They couldn’t overturn it.</p>\r\n<div id=\"UBu3rY\">\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\r\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIAvsKC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MIAvsKC</a>, the receiver had control of the football but there was no definitive angle to determine if his first foot is in bounds.
